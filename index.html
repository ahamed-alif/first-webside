            <p>i'm a boy like everyone else, but i think a little too much about some things. it feels good when someone
                does
                something good ,like everyone else,i want to do the same. but not everyone is like everyone else! each
                person is
                different. but i like to walk with everyone. i am the only son of my parents and they love me a lot.</p>
